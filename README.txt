To run this program, run the NaiveBayesPrintout class, which contains a main method. 
All of the experimental results will be printed to the console.

This class uses Naive Byes to classify news documents. It outputs a confusion
matrix for its performance on classifying each set of data. It was origionally created as an assignment. 
The assignment description pdf is titled lab1.pdf.
  
The files input into the classifier are a processed version of the
20Newsgroups data set. The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of
approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across
20 different newsgroups. It was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably
for his "Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews" paper, though he did not 
explicitly mention this collection.
